Document ingestion and embedding generation.
Question answering using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model.
API integration to interact with the frontend and other backend services.
Features
Document Ingestion: Accepts documents and generates embeddings for efficient retrieval.
Question Answering: Processes user questions and provides contextually accurate responses.
FastAPI Framework: Utilizes FastAPI for high-performance API services.

How to Run:
Start the backend:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Run the frontend (if applicable):
ng serve

API Endpoints:
Provide a list of all API endpoints and their usage.
Example:

POST /ingest
Request Body:
{
    "doc_id": "doc1",
    "content": "example content"
}
Testing Instructions:
How to run the tests using pytest:

pytest
Dependencies:
List all major dependencies (e.g., FastAPI, httpx) and their versions.

===============================================================================================================

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+: Ensure Python is installed. Download Python
Pip: Ensure pip is installed for dependency management.
Virtual Environment: Recommended for isolating dependencies.
Installation
Navigate to the Python_Backend directory.
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the Python_Backend directory with the necessary environment variables. Example:

DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
Running the Application

}
Testing
Unit Testing
Run unit tests using pytest:

pytest
Test Structure
test_api.py: Tests for API endpoints.
test_ingestion.py: Tests for ingestion logic.
test_qna.py: Tests for question answering logic.
Docker Integration
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is included for containerizing the backend service.

Build Docker Image
From the Python_Backend directory:

docker build -t python-backend .
Run Docker Container
Run the container:


docker run -p 8000:8000 python-backend
The application will be accessible at:


http://127.0.0.1:8000
Docker Compose
A docker-compose.yml file is included to simplify multi-container setups.

Start Services
Run the following command to bring up all services:

docker-compose up

Key Notes
Ensure the backend is tested with pytest before deployment.
Update the .env file for production environment variables.
Coordinate with the frontend and NestJS backend teams for API integration.
Checklist Before Deployment
Run tests:

pytest
Build and test the Docker image:

docker build -t python-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 python-backend
Verify all endpoints are functional with Postman or similar tools.
